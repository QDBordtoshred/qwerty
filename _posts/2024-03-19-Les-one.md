# Group 1 (Enemies)
## Code Structure:
Let's start with the code structure. We have a class called Goomba, which extends another class called Character. This means the Goomba inherits properties and behaviors from the Character class.

## Constructor Method:
The constructor method is like a blueprint for creating a Goomba. It takes parameters such as the canvas, image, data, position percentages, name, and minimum position. These parameters help set up the Goomba's initial state and behavior.

``` constructor(canvas, image, data, xPercentage, yPercentage, name, minPosition) {
    super(canvas, image, data, 0.0, 0.2);
    // Initialize properties like position, speed, and immunity
    // Adjust speed based on game difficulty
}
```
## Update Method:
The update() method is where the Goomba's behavior is updated over time. It handles movement, boundary checks, random events, and immunity based on the game difficulty.

``` update() {
    // Update position, check boundaries, handle random events
    // Change direction based on difficulty
    // Apply visual effects like brightness or scale
}
```
## Collision Handling:
The collisionAction() method deals with what happens when the Goomba collides with other game elements. For example, if it collides with a player or a platform, it triggers specific actions like changing direction or destroying itself.

``` collisionAction() {
    // Handle collisions with player, other Goombas, tubes, etc.
    // Apply effects like bouncing, transformation, or destruction
}
```
## Code Walkthrough:
Let's walk through the code step by step. First, we set up the Goomba's initial position and speed. Then, we update its behavior based on the game difficulty, handle collisions, and apply visual effects when necessary.

## Conclusion:
Overall, the Goomba class encapsulates the logic and behavior of a Goomba character in a game. By understanding how the code works, we can create dynamic and interactive game elements that contribute to the overall gaming experience.

# Homework Assignment: Modifying the Goomba Class

## Objective:
> Apply the concepts learned from the lesson on the Goomba class by making edits and additions to the provided code.

### Instructions:
1. Download the provided Goomba.js file containing the Goomba class code. (everyone should already have this)
2. Review the lesson material on the Goomba class structure, update method, collision handling, and code walkthrough.
3. Complete **ONE** of the following tasks for up to a 0.8/1 or coplete **two** for up to 1/1 by editing the Goomba.js file:
- Task 1: Adjust the speed calculation in the constructor method based on the "impossible" difficulty level.
- Task 2: Add a new visual effect to the Goomba when it collides with a jump platform (e.g., change color or display a particle effect).
- Task 3: Implement a feature that increases the Goomba's size gradually over time while the game is running.
4. Test your modified Goomba class by integrating it into a game environment or using a simulator.
5. Create a issue summarizing the changes you made, explaining how they enhance the Goomba's behavior and visual effects.

## Submision 

Create an issue including a link to the running game with the changes made, a screanshot of the code you added and or edited, and a short pragraph summarizing the changes you made, explaining how they enhance the Goomba's behavior and visual effects.
