# Group 1 (Enemies)
## Code Structure:
Let's start with the code structure. We have a class called Goomba, which extends another class called Character. This means the Goomba inherits properties and behaviors from the Character class.

## Constructor Method:
The constructor method is like a blueprint for creating a Goomba. It takes parameters such as the canvas, image, data, position percentages, name, and minimum position. These parameters help set up the Goomba's initial state and behavior.

``` constructor(canvas, image, data, xPercentage, yPercentage, name, minPosition) {
    super(canvas, image, data, 0.0, 0.2);
    // Initialize properties like position, speed, and immunity
    // Adjust speed based on game difficulty
}
```
## Update Method:
The update() method is where the Goomba's behavior is updated over time. It handles movement, boundary checks, random events, and immunity based on the game difficulty.

``` update() {
    // Update position, check boundaries, handle random events
    // Change direction based on difficulty
    // Apply visual effects like brightness or scale
}
```
## Collision Handling:
The collisionAction() method deals with what happens when the Goomba collides with other game elements. For example, if it collides with a player or a platform, it triggers specific actions like changing direction or destroying itself.

``` collisionAction() {
    // Handle collisions with player, other Goombas, tubes, etc.
    // Apply effects like bouncing, transformation, or destruction
}
```
## Code Walkthrough:
Let's walk through the code step by step. First, we set up the Goomba's initial position and speed. Then, we update its behavior based on the game difficulty, handle collisions, and apply visual effects when necessary.

## Conclusion:
Overall, the Goomba class encapsulates the logic and behavior of a Goomba character in a game. By understanding how the code works, we can create dynamic and interactive game elements that contribute to the overall gaming experience.
